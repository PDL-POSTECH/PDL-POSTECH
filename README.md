### 🧠 About Us

> We design and engineer proteins to self-assemble them into complex nanostructures for biomedical applications.

We design protein nanostructures with useful structural, chemical, and biological properties. Based on chemical & physical principles, geometrical knowledge, and machine learning, we design proteins **computationally** and validate them **experimentally**. By iterating computational and experimental approaches, we improve the protein design methods and develop new design principles.

- 🔗 Applications: 
  Our designed protein nanostructures can be used for biomedical applications such as vaccines, gene therapeutics, cell-to-cell communications. 
- 🧠 AI for protein science (hopefully...)
